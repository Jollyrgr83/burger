## Installation Instructions
This project was designed to work on any browser. The backend uses the npm packages "express", "express-handlebars", "mysql", and their associated dependencies.

## Usage
burger is an app that allows users to track the status of burgers that they would like to eat and then mark them as eaten. Enter the name of the burger that you would like to eat in the input field and then click the "Submit" button. Burgers that you would like to eat show up on the left side of the page. To update the status of a burger, click the associated "Devour!" button. It will then show up on the right side of the screen with the rest of the burgers that you have already eaten. To remove a burger from the list, click the "Delete!" button.
